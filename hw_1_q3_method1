# Method_1
# The idea: Use the second loop to find the longest alphabetical substring started from the index i
# Time complexity is O(n^2),space complexity is O(n)
# Notes: 1. substring/subarray(子串) need to be continues, while subsuquence(子序列) may or may not to be continues

        if s[j] <= s[j+1]:
            j += 1
            #print("what is the max counter",max_counter)
            if abs(j-i) > max_counter:
